# Water_Leak_Detection_using_Neural_Networks
The primary goal of the project is to leverage recent  developments  in  smart  water  technologies  to  detect and  reduce  water  leakages  in  large  water  distribution  networks  with  the  aid  of  neural  networks.  We  address  the problem of demand for well equipped and maintained homes by proposing a cost effective solution to detect leakages and manage  pressure,  which  in  turn  leads  to  significant  water savings  and  reduced  pipe  breakage  frequencies,  especially in older infrastructure systems.This is a research project under Dept of Civil, Construction, and Environmental Engineering. Developed two different  models,  the  first  one,  which  is  a  classification  model,is  based  on  Supervised  Self-Organising  Maps  using  SuSi framework, which can perform unsupervised, supervised and semi-supervised classification and regression tasks on high dimensional data. The second model, which is a regression model, is based on Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) algorithm, which  is  a  class  of  feedforward  Artificial  Neural  Networks (ANNs).The results of the evaluation can be summarized in three major findings: 
• Both  models  were  able  to  correctly  classify  the  leaknodes with good accuracy.
• The  Multi-Layer  Perceptron  model  outperforms  the Self-Organising Maps model.
• There  isn’t  always  need  of  a  complex  model.  Simple MLP  model  achieve  better  accuracy  as  compared  to complex SOM model.
